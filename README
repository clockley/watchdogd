SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
-----------

	A watchdog timer(WDT) is an electronic timer that is used to automatically
	recover from software or hardware error. Normally a software program(in this case watchdogd)
	restarts the watchdog timer to prevent it from timing out and rebooting the system.

	In addition the regularly resetting the WDT, watchdogd(the daemon) can be configured to
	actively monitor key system metrics and take appropriate action via repair scripts.

	watchdogd comes with several built-in test:

	* Ping IP addresses and check for answer(IPv4 and IPv6)

	* Check load average

	* Execute check/repair scripts found in /etc/watchdog.d

	* Execute a user defined an arbitrary command.
