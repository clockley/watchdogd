I plan to add these features in the next major release: May 2022
 1. Ability to send email on important status changes via sendmail.
 2. Add support for sending text messages with Twilio. You will have to supply your own
 API key. Additionally I will use an abstraction layer to make it easy to use other SMS API's.
 3. Ability to add/remove repair scripts without restarting daemon. user would simply
register/unregister scripts with a provided tool. I'll also include a command line
utility to interface with the dbus API. I plan to allocate enough memory for 2^32
repair scripts. Note preallocated memory will not be locked until actually used so most systems should be ok. I project the preallocation will cost about 2GiB virtual memory.
 4. Deprecate support for v1 repair scripts (May 2022)
 5. Web interface/REST API
 6. Web interface
 7. Use Squirrel for embedded scripting.

Features 1,2 and 3 should be ready in a beta by Dec 2021.
